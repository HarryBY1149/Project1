Recipe Finder uses the Edamam suite of API's to take in user input and search for recipes.
The app dynamically displays result, including nutritional information, and allows for temporary database storage via firebase.

Built with HTML5, CSS3, JS, J.Query, and Firebase.

Known issues: The free tier of the Edamam API only allows for 5 queries a minute.  Anything more than that will trigger a 500 error.
The tier of the API also only allows limited access to the query paramaters available.
